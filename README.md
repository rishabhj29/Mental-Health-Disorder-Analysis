**Overview:**


This project explores societal and environmental factors contributing to mental health disorders, going beyond economic conditions to uncover key influences like green spaces, COâ‚‚ emissions, and research investments. Using data analytics and machine learning, the study aims to identify patterns, predict anxiety prevalence, and suggest data-driven interventions for improving mental well-being.  

**Key Objectives:**


âœ… Identify Global Mental Health Trends â€“ Analyze datasets to uncover patterns in mental health disorders across countries.  
âœ… Understand Environmental & Economic Influences â€“ Examine the impact of GDP, education, healthcare spending, COâ‚‚ emissions, and renewable energy on mental health.  
âœ… Predict Anxiety Prevalence â€“ Develop machine learning models (Random Forest, Clustering, 3D Linear Regression) to forecast anxiety rates.  
âœ… Propose Policy Recommendations â€“ Advocate for nature-integrated therapies, sustainability policies, and increased research investment.  

**Data & Methodology:**  


**ðŸ“Š Datasets Used:**  
- Global Trends in Mental Health Disorders (Our World in Data)  
- World Development Indicators (World Bank)  
- Welcome Global Monitor (Mental health perceptions survey)  

**ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques:**  
- Data Wrangling & Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Excel  
- Visualization & Exploration: Tableau, Power BI  
- Machine Learning: Random Forest (98% RÂ²), K-Means Clustering, 3D Linear Regression  

**Key Insights & Findings:**  


ðŸ“Œ Life expectancy is the most significant predictor of anxiety prevalence.  
ðŸ“Œ Green spaces reduce mental health risks, reinforcing natureâ€™s role in mental well-being.  
ðŸ“Œ Higher COâ‚‚ emissions and reduced research spending correlate with increased anxiety disorders.  
ðŸ“Œ Investment in research & sustainable policies can improve mental health outcomes.  

**Impact & Future Scope:** 
 
This project provides evidence-based insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and environmental advocates to integrate sustainability-focused mental health interventions. Future work can explore real-time mental health tracking, social determinants, and policy-based implementations to enhance global mental well-being.
